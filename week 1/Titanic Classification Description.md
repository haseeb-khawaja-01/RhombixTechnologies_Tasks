Titanic Survival Prediction 
This project uses a Random Forest Classifier in Python to predict whether Titanic passengers survived based on key details such as travel class, gender, age, family members aboard, fare, and embarkation port. The dataset was cleaned by handling missing values and converting categorical data into numeric form. The model was trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%, achieving an accuracy of about 81.5%. Results include an accuracy score, classification report, confusion matrix, and a feature importance chart to highlight which factors most influenced survival. This work was completed as part of the Rhombix Technologies Internship.
